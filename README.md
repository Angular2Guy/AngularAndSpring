# AngularAndSpring

This is an example application to shows howto use Spring Boot, Angular and Mongodb with the reactive features of Spring.

The goal is to be reactive from top to bottom. To do that the project uses Angular in the frontend and Spring Boot with Reactive Web as server. Mongodb is the database connected with the reactive MongoDB driver. That enables a reactive chain from the browser to the DB.
